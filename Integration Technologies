Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the 
Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with 
Amazon Web Services Academy

The following are the keypoints of this article:
・A cloud computing module was redesigned to integrate industry-based hands-on labs, 
improving student engagement and skills by combining theoretical knowledge 
with practical experience, which enhances employability in cloud computing.
・Rising Tuition Fees - tuition fees in the UK and US have increased significantly, 
leading to concerns from students, parents, and guardians
・Rising Justification for Fee Increase -students and parents are demanding 
improved education quality, more resources, and job opportunities to
 justify the higher tuition costs.
・Employability Demands Graduates need more than subject-specific 
knowledge to secure jobs. Employers are seeking graduates with 
the right skills, knowledge, and attitudes to be "work-ready."
・Industry Involvement in Curriculum Design Involving employers in 
curriculum design ensures graduates acquire the necessary employability skills,
 leading to better employment outcomes. Work experience during 
studies also boosts employability.
・Student Engagement and Learning Tools E-learning platforms, such as AWS Academy’s, 
include user-friendly dashboards and performance prediction tools, 
enhancing student engagement and providing insights for
nstructors to monitor progress. Social aspects of LMS platforms 
help create a balanced and interactive learning environment.

By designing the cloud computing lectures, it was mentioned that this study 
focuses on designing a cloud computing curriculum at 
Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in alignment with the university's strategic aims,
 particularly around education and employability. The curriculum integrates hands-on
 practical skills via AWS Academy’s LMS, which is used to teach students 
about key cloud computing topics like virtualization, scalability, 
and data analytics. Labs and tests make up 25% of the overall 
exam marks to encourage engagement. The curriculum also 
incorporates employability by mapping skills to various career paths 
in cloud computing. International comparisons were made with top universities
to ensure the course covers essential cloud computing topics, 
and new technologies like GPUs and CUDA programming were added. 
This approach aims to equip students with both 
theoretical knowledge and practical skills to enhance their job readiness.
