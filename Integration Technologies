In the following, these are the key points of the Research where we can easily understand the research better.
• The article discusses about the redesigning of a cloud computing undergraduate module in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy, including industry-based practical labs to improving the engineering students skills in the Internet of Things.
• This is because in this study they find that students can participate and learn when abstract knowledge and understanding are combined together in real life situations through industry connections. 
• Rising university tuition fees in the UK and USA are a concern for students and their families.
• UK tuition fees tripled in 2015, with home students paying at least GBP 9,000 (USD 13,800) per year, and international students paying a minimum of GBP 14,000 (USD 17,800).
• Universities in the UK can charge higher fees depending on the course; for instance, Russell Group universities charge international students up to GBP 23,700 for engineering programs.
• Parents and students demand improved education quality, including better resources, learning experiences, and job opportunities to justify the fee increases.
• Universities argue that increased fees are necessary to provide industry-relevant skills, particularly in fields like cloud computing.
• Queen Mary University of London partnered with AWS Academy to enhance its cloud computing curriculum, offering hands-on labs and industry expertise.
• The partnership includes AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner training for instructors and exposure to career paths, internships, and employment opportunities for students.
